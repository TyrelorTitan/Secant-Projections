# Secant-Projections
Python implementation of the PCA manifold secant heuristic for linear feature extraction.

The complete method is given in:
Li, Y. et al., "Compressive image acquisition and classification via secant
projections," Journal of Optics 17.6, 2015.

Note: The paper also describes a Semi-Definite Programming approach. This is available in Matlab here: https://github.com/image-science-lab/NuMax.
